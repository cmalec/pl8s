# Building for every Pebble

Source: <https://developer.repebble.com/guides/best-practices/building-for-every-pebble/>

Platform capability differences (Basalt, Chalk and Emery support 64 colors;
Aplite, Diorite and Flint support two; platform-specific APIs such as Health or
Dictation) make rich apps hard to keep compatible. To make life simple for users,
**strive to write one app that can be used on all platforms** — the SDK provides
several ways to accommodate different hardware capabilities in code.

## Preprocessor directives

`#ifdef` blocks let you compile code for specific purposes. Exclude the
`Dictation` API on platforms with no microphone:

```c
#if defined(PBL_MICROPHONE)
  // Start dictation UI
  dictation_session_start(s_dictation_session);
#else
  // Microphone is not available
  text_layer_set_text(s_some_layer, "Dictation not available!");
#endif
```

Colors on compatible platforms can be adapted to black or white on non-color
platforms. `PBL_COLOR` and `PBL_BW` are defined at compile time as appropriate:

```c
#if defined(PBL_COLOR)
  text_layer_set_text_color(s_text_layer, GColorRed);
  text_layer_set_background_color(s_text_layer, GColorChromeYellow);
#else
  text_layer_set_text_color(s_text_layer, GColorWhite);
  text_layer_set_background_color(s_text_layer, GColorBlack);
#endif
```

For a **single statement**, use the `PBL_IF_COLOR_ELSE()` macro instead:

```c
window_set_background_color(s_main_window, PBL_IF_COLOR_ELSE(GColorJaegerGreen, GColorBlack));
```

Macros suit individual value selection; defines suit selecting an entire block of
code.

> It is **strongly recommended** to conditionally compile code using applicable
> **feature** defines instead of `PBL_PLATFORM` defines, to be as specific as
> possible. Features are the stable axis; platforms come and go.

## API detection

Beyond platform and capability detection, API detection tests whether a specific
API method is available. This is the most future-proof approach, since platforms
and capabilities may come and go:

```c
#if PBL_API_EXISTS(health_service_peek_current_value)
 // Do something if specific Health API exists
#endif
```

## Avoid hardcoded layout values

With multiple display shapes and resolutions, avoid hardcoding layout values:

```c
static void window_load(Window *window) {
  // Create a full-screen Layer - BAD
  s_some_layer = layer_create(GRect(0, 0, 144, 168));
}
```

That covers the whole screen on Aplite, Basalt, Diorite and Flint — but **not** on
Chalk or Emery. Use the `UnobstructedArea` bounds of the `Window` itself:

```c
static void window_load(Window *window) {
  // Get the unobstructed bounds of the Window
  Layer window_layer = window_get_root_layer(window);
  GRect window_bounds = layer_get_unobstructed_bounds(window_layer);

  // Properly create a full-screen Layer - GOOD
  s_some_layer = layer_create(window_bounds);
}
```

Proportional values follow the same rule — half the unobstructed height:

```c
GRect layer_bounds = window_bounds;
layer_bounds.size.h /= 2;

// Create a Layer that is half the screen height
s_some_layer = layer_create(layer_bounds);
```

This also simplifies adapting an app to a future screen size, since proportional
values adapt automatically as the unobstructed bounds change.

Note "unobstructed": the timeline can push a *peek* over the bottom of the
display, and the plain `layer_get_bounds()` value does not account for it.

## Screen sizes

New compiler directives let you determine screen width and height. This is
preferable to platform detection, since **multiple platforms share the same
screen width and height**:

```c
#if PBL_DISPLAY_HEIGHT == 228
  uint8_t offset_y = 100;
#elif PBL_DISPLAY_HEIGHT == 180
  uint8_t offset_y = 80;
#else
  uint8_t offset_y = 60;
#endif
```

> Although preferable to platform detection, it is even better to **dynamically
> calculate** width and height from the unobstructed bounds of the root layer.

## Pebble C WatchInfo

The `WatchInfo` API determines exactly which Pebble model and color an app is
running on, so an app can dynamically modify layout or behavior.

For example, the display on Pebble Steel sits at a different vertical position
relative to the buttons than on Pebble Time. On-screen button hints can be
adjusted with `WatchInfoModel`:

```c
static void window_load(Window *window) {
  Layer window_layer = window_get_root_layer(window);
  GRect window_bounds = layer_get_bounds(window_layer);

  int button_height, y_offset;

  // Conditionally set layout parameters
  switch(watch_info_get_model()) {
    case WATCH_INFO_MODEL_PEBBLE_STEEL:
      y_offset = 64;
      button_height = 44;
      break;
    case WATCH_INFO_MODEL_PEBBLE_TIME:
      y_offset = 58;
      button_height = 56;
      break;

    /* Other cases */

    default:
      y_offset = 0;
      button_height = 0;
      break;

  }

  // Set the Layer frame
  GRect layer_frame = GRect(0, y_offset, window_bounds.size.w, button_height);

  // Create the Layer
  s_label_layer = text_layer_create(layer_frame);
  layer_add_child(window_layer, text_layer_get_layer(s_label_layer));

  /* Other UI code */

}
```

`WatchInfoColor` values theme an app per watch color:

```c
static void window_load(Window *window) {
  GColor text_color, background_color;

  // Choose different theme colors per watch color
  switch(watch_info_get_color()) {
    case WATCH_INFO_COLOR_RED:
      // Red theme
      text_color = GColorWhite;
      background_color = GColorRed;
      break;
    case WATCH_INFO_COLOR_BLUE:
      // Blue theme
      text_color = GColorBlack;
      background_color = GColorVeryLightBlue;
      break;

    /* Other cases */

    default:
      text_color = GColorBlack;
      background_color = GColorWhite;
      break;

  }

  // Use the conditionally set value
  text_layer_set_text_color(s_label_layer, text_color);
  text_layer_set_background_color(s_label_layer, background_color);

  /* Other UI code */

}
```

## PebbleKit JS watch info

The PebbleKit JS `Pebble.getActiveWatchInfo()` method determines which model and
color of Pebble the user has, plus the firmware version. To obtain the model:

> See the section below on avoiding problems using this function on older app
> versions.

```javascript
// Get the watch info
var info = Pebble.getActiveWatchInfo();

console.log('Pebble model: ' + info.model);
```

## Detecting platform-specific JS features

Several PebbleKit JS features (`Pebble.timelineSubscribe()`,
`Pebble.getActiveWatchInfo()`) exist only on SDK 3.x. Calling them on an older
Pebble mobile app version **crashes the JS app**.

Check for the function before calling it:

```javascript
if (Pebble.getActiveWatchInfo) {
  // Available.
  var info = Pebble.getActiveWatchInfo();

  console.log('Pebble model: ' + info.model);
} else {
  // Gracefully handle no info available

}
```

## Platform-specific resources

Including both color and black-and-white versions of a resource is expensive from
a storage perspective, and burdens an Aplite/Diorite/Flint build with redundant
color resources.

The SDK lets you specify which version of an image resource is used per display
type, using `~bw` or `~color` appended to a file name. Resources can also be
bundled only with specific platforms via the `targetPlatforms` property.

For the full tag list and packaging details, see
[Platform-specific resources](../../pebble-app-resources/references/platform-specific.md).

## Multiple display shapes

Use defines to distinguish the two display shapes:

```c
#if defined(PBL_RECT)
  printf("This is a rectangular display!");
#elif defined(PBL_ROUND)
  printf("This is a round display!");
#endif
```

Or the macros, which avoid a `#define` block and drop four lines of verbosity:

```c
// Conditionally print out the shape of the display
printf("This is a %s display!", PBL_IF_RECT_ELSE("rectangular", "round"));
```

Best used with window-bounds-derived layout size and position. See
[Avoid hardcoded layout values](#avoid-hardcoded-layout-values) above. Making good
use of the builtin `Layer` types also safeguards apps against display shape and
size changes.

One more consideration for round displays: **each horizontal line of text has a
different available width**, depending on its vertical position. See
[Round app design](../../pebble-design/references/in-the-round.md) for the
pagination technique that handles this.
